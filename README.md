# Symmetry-Mario

This project corresponds to the computational model based on symmetry for generating visually pleasing maps of platform games, described in https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AIIDE/AIIDE16/paper/viewFile/14016/13596 .

Namely, in this work we introduced a computational model based on the concept of symmetry for generating visually pleasing
game maps. We cast the problem of generating symmetrical maps as an optimization task and propose a B&B approach
to solve it. We used two types of symmetry as objective funcion: One we called "The Vertical Symmetry Function" and other we called "The All Symmetries Function".

The generated small levels can be concatenated for generating comlete playable levels of the game Infinite Mario Bros (IMB), a clone of the Super Mario Bros game from Nintendo.
